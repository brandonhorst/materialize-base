```

Bases is a [core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins) that lets you create
database-like views of your notes. Using a base you can view, edit, sort, and
filter files and their [properties](https://help.obsidian.md/properties). Bases
can help you organize everything from projects to travel plans, reading lists,
and more.

Each base can have several [views](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views) with
different layouts such as tables and cards. Below is an example of table view
where each row is a file, and each column is a property of that file.

All the data in Obsidian Bases is stored in your local
[Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax) files and their
[properties](https://help.obsidian.md/properties). The views are described by
the [Bases syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/syntax), which can be saved as
a `.base` file or
[embedded](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/create-base#Embed%20a%20base) in code
blocks within your Markdown files.
